# NetworkScanners

Just did this out of fun and learning experience of Python.

Two different scanners for searching for open ports of ip addresses on your network. 

IP_Scanner will scan one specific ip from starting to ending amount of ports.

networkPortScanner will search all of the ips on your network for common ports.
